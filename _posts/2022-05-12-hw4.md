In this blog, I will develop and assess a fake news classifer using Tensorflow.

# 1. Acquire Training Data
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
train_url = "https://github.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16b/blob/master/datasets/fake_news_train.csv?raw=true"
df = pd.read_csv(train_url)
```
Using  `df.head()` check the data that get from train_url.
```
df.head()
```
